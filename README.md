# RimworldSuccessionGame

Taken from the Forum thread here: https://ludeon.com/forums/index.php?topic=24214.0

Anyone interested in doing a ''sucession'' game ? I used to do this with people when I was playing Dwarf Fortress. Basically you take control of a game on a ''hot seat'' format, where each player plays the same game for a pre-determined length of time and then passes it on to the next player in line and so on. Each players records the major events during his ''turn'' and posts it up for other to see. It created some epic stories in dwarf fortress like the infamous http://lparchive.org/Dwarf-Fortress-Boatmurdered/ 

If you are interested, drop me a line here. Cheers !
