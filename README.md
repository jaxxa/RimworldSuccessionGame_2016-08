# RimworldSuccessionGame

Taken from the Forum thread here: https://ludeon.com/forums/index.php?topic=24214.0

Anyone interested in doing a ''sucession'' game ? I used to do this with people when I was playing Dwarf Fortress. Basically you take control of a game on a ''hot seat'' format, where each player plays the same game for a pre-determined length of time and then passes it on to the next player in line and so on. Each players records the major events during his ''turn'' and posts it up for other to see. It created some epic stories in dwarf fortress like the infamous http://lparchive.org/Dwarf-Fortress-Boatmurdered/ 

If you are interested, drop me a line here. Cheers !

### Simple Rules: 
* One season per player 
* No reloads 
* Max 2 days on the game then send it to the other dude (no way to enforce it guys but it will be more fun like that) 
* Document your reign as Overseer send me what you get and I'll try to post it on the Stories board (if someone has a better idea or skills to create a share page where we can add our stories let me know)
